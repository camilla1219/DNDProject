# Project Formulation: Online Survey Generator

The objective of this project is to develop an online survey generator that enables users to easily create, distribute, and analyze customized surveys. Through a user-friendly interface, users can log into their accounts and design surveys with a variety of question formats, including multiple-choice, text responses, and rating scales. Once surveys are distributed, the system will automatically collect and analyze the responses, presenting the results in visually intuitive charts and graphs for more effective insights.

This tool is intended to provide a seamless experience for students, educators, and professionals who need to gather feedback, conduct research, or collect data. Similar to existing platforms like SurveyMonkey, this survey generator will be tailored for student use, focusing on simplicity, ease of use, and cost-effectiveness.
